# General Questions

1. What did you learn yesterday/this week?

   - The Fibonacci Sequence, it is a set of numbers that start with either "0" or "1" followed by a "1", and continues on the absolute rule that each number (known as a "Fibonacci Number") is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

2. What excites or interests you about coding?

   - The process of creation and problem solving within the unknown of that which we create, code is infinite in the sense that its in a constant state of growth much like technology today, there is always something new to learn regardless of level and always new understanding that can be gleamed regardless of depth, being able to be apart of that process, facing new challenges and problems to solve everyday thrills me and keeps me humble at the same time.

3. What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?

   - The concept of AVL Trees within Binary Trees and how to understand balancing and rotating them with height. I used a visualtion tool to help me absorb this process. [AVL Tree Visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html)

4. When building a new web site or maintaining one, can you explain some techniques you have used to increase performance?

   - Keeping my code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself Principal), by reducing the repetition of software patterns and opting to replace it with abstractions or data normalization it means we avoid redundancy and in doing so the software / code itself can be read much faster and efficiently increasing the speed at which the app or program delivers and functions itself, in addition to the code being much cleaner and readable for any person and or Developer.

    - Pseudo Coding, by writing out the implementation of a function or algorithm beforehand with annotation and informative text in plain english, it helps me breakdown complexities to smaller pieces that can be digested to write out a function or algorithm that hits exactly where you want it to hit, and give foresight in more efficient ways to write out the function or algorithm ultimately leading to a function or algorithm that is refined and concise, the more refined the function or algorithm is the better it executes therein increasing overall performance of your code.

5. Can you describe some SEO best practices or techniques you have used lately?

    - Add the Main Keyword Early On In my Content, Google puts more weight on terms that appear on top of a webpage so the location of your Main Keyword is important.

    - Writing Unique Titles, Descriptions and Content, avodiing duplicate content is one of the most important SEO best practices to be mindful of, Google itself stated that you should avoid “duplicate or near-duplicate versions of your content across your site.”.

    - Optimize the Title Tag for SEO, When it comes to on-page SEO, the title tag is KEY. Search engines pay close attention to the terms that you use in your title tag. Which is why you want your keyword in your page title.
    Google has also stated that: “it’s important to use high-quality titles on your web pages.”.
