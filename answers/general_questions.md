# General Questions

1. What did you learn yesterday/this week?
    - The Fibonacci Sequence, it is a set of numbers that start with either "0" or "1" followed by a "1", and continues on the absolute rule that each number (known as a "Fibonacci Number") is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers.

2. What excites or interests you about coding?
    - The process of creation and problem solving within the unknown of that which we create, code is infinite in the sense that its in a constant state of growth much like technology today, there is always something new to learn regardless of level and always new understanding that can be gleamed regardless of depth, being able to be apart of that process, facing new challenges and problems to solve everyday thrills me and keeps me humble at the same time.

3. What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
    - The concept of AVL Trees within Binary Trees and how to understand balancing and rotating them with height. I used a visualtion tool to help me absorb this process. [AVL Tree Visualization](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/AVLtree.html)
